# Making an Outdoor Living Room: Technical Reference

## Motivation

The project addresses the need for a functional outdoor space that provides protection from sun exposure and facilitates outdoor cooking. The motivation stems from practical concerns: avoiding UV damage to personal belongings and oneself, and managing cooking smells and heat.

## Problem Statement

Creating an outdoor living area requires a shelter that is easy to set up, durable, and adaptable to available anchor points. Additionally, a basic kitchen setup is needed that does not rely on permanent fixtures or expensive equipment.

## Implementation Overview

The core of the project is a tarp shelter rigged with a ridge line between two anchor points. The tarp is arranged in an oblong diamond shape to optimize coverage for the specific location. The shelter is secured without stakes by tying grommets to existing structures such as fence posts, a grill, and storm drains.

The tarp is tensioned using a combination of knots: clove hitches and half hitches on the anchor side, and constrictor knots combined with trucker’s hitches on the opposite side. These choices balance security and ease of adjustment.

Midpoint tie-outs extend the tarp’s coverage. In cases of damage, improvised solutions such as fabric balls are used as anchor points.

The outdoor kitchen setup is minimalistic, involving a table (optional), a stove, a rice cooker, and a water boiler. Seating is informal, initially using a found chair or squatting on the ground.

## Technical Details

### Knots Used

- **Clove Hitch**: Used for initial anchor attachment, provides quick and adjustable binding.
- **Half Hitch**: Secures the clove hitch to prevent slippage.
- **Trucker’s Hitch**: Provides mechanical advantage for tensioning the ridge line.
- **Constrictor Knot**: Used on the tensioning side for a secure grip.
- **Alpine Butterfly**: Mentioned as a skill, likely used for creating mid-line loops.

### Materials

- Tarp with grommets
- Bank line (strong cordage)
- Miscellaneous found objects for anchors
- Basic camping stove and cooking appliances

### Setup Steps

1. Establish a high, tight ridge line between two anchor points.
2. Pull the tarp over the ridge line in an oblong diamond pattern.
3. Anchor the tarp bottom grommets to fixed structures.
4. Tie out midpoints to extend coverage.
5. Arrange kitchen components under the shelter.

## Practical Considerations

- The setup avoids reliance on stakes, adapting to urban or constrained environments.
- Knot selection prioritizes security and adjustability.
- The tarp shape is customized to site conditions.
- The kitchen setup is flexible and low-cost.

## Summary

This project serves as a practical guide for creating a functional outdoor living and cooking space using minimal resources. The documentation captures knot techniques, material choices, and layout strategies to facilitate replication or modification in similar contexts.
