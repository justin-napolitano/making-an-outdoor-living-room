This repo sets up a framework for designing and visualizing outdoor living spaces. It leverages React and Three.js for interactive 3D rendering, making it easy to see how different layouts and furniture arrangements work in a virtual space.

### Key Components:
- **React** for the UI
- **Three.js** for 3D graphics
- **Styled Components** for styling

### Quick Start:
1. Clone the repo:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/justin-napolitano/making-an-outdoor-living-room.git
   cd making-an-outdoor-living-room
   ```
2. Install dependencies:
   ```bash
   npm install
   ```
3. Run the app:
   ```bash
   npm start
   ```

### Gotchas:
- Ensure you have Node.js installed (at least version 12).
- If you run into issues with rendering, check your WebGL support.
  
That's it! Dive in and start visualizing your outdoor space.
